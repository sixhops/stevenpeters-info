			<p id="biotext">Cullen Gray brings a visual stimulus to the world of steel string fingerstyle. This unique guitarist shows great promise and passion for original acoustic music. Utilizing alternate tunings, extended techniques, multiple capos, various effects units and loop pedals as he forges an eclectic sound from all different facets.
 			<br /><br />
			Spending a majority of his youth being self taught allowed him to fully explore and develop his own inspirations for what he sought to accomplish with the guitar. His first concert being at Book Beat, a local coffee shop in Fairfax, California at age 14. 
			<br /><br />
			Two years later he had a life changing experience that pushed him full force into the performing world. In 2007 he was able to share the stage with long time idol Trace Bundy. And once again a year and a half later, the two performed. Gray continued to perform throughout California, sharing the stage with other steel string artists such as Teja Gerken, Vicki Genfan, and Jeff Titus.
			<br /><br />
			In 2010 at age 19, he began studying at Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle WA under the personal study of his first-ever guitar teacher Michael Nicolella, an internationally renowned contemporary classical guitarist and composer. During their time together Gray has honed his craft and technique through classical training. Gray graduated in 2014 with a degree in performance for Classical Guitar.
			<br /><br />
			Gray is currently working towards recording his first studio album.

					<p class="presstext">"Cullen's music is not to be missed - an up and coming guitarist with a lot of guts. He's got a great passion for the guitar and the skills to match. Watch out world!"
					- Trace Bundy</p>
					<p class="presstext">"I came in from the wet and cold to a steamy and warm room. On the stage was acoustic guitar wizard Cullen Gray and I was spell bound as he wove electronic loops and steal strings together for a hypnotic set of dreamy and psychedelic songs on his six-string. It amazed me that one person and one instrument could make such incredible sounds."
					- Elliot Karlan</p>
					<p class="presstext">"Your guitar skills sounded so professional and had that sweet "look-I-have-four-hands" vibe."
					- Samantha McCoppen</p>
					<p class="presstext">"Cullen Gray breaths and eats, and occasionally bleeds acoustic music,
					depending on how well he is performing during any given concert of his.
					He discovers treasure chests in the hearts of abandoned automobiles. He
					can sing in four part harmony with himself. When he slaps his bass, his
					bass slaps you. Cullen Gray is the culinary equivalent of a very successful
					hypnotism session. He once climbed Mount Olympus, and at its glorious
					snowy peak, he leaped and flew thousands upon thousands of miles. His
					guitar has been seen riding rabid whales through the Mojave Desert."
					- Evan Greenwald</p>
